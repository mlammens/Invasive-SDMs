# Project Log for Invsives SDM project

## Project Goal


## Ideas

This project started as building an SDM of Frangula alnus to use in a linked distribution and demographic model. 
However, based on feedback from reviewers on this manuscript (rejected from Biological Invasions in 4/2020), I've decided to separate the two sections of that MS and expand on the SDM version.

My goal is to model ca. 9 to 12 species, selecting from the LHPRISM Tier List. 
This project will focus on woody invasive species, and will include Frangula alnus.
